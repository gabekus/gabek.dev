    Since middle school, I enjoyed tech and problem solving. I'd solve Rubik's cubes, (attempt to)
    recreate my favorite games in Scratch (link here), make websites with friends in my school's
    student-led coding club, and create mods for the videogames I played.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exploring new hobbies, I took up piano at the end of high school, which quickly became a
    new favorite interest as I'd spend hours every day for years diving into music theory, chords, progressive
    metal, jazz fusion, city pop, and some other genres you probably haven't heard of if you aren't
    a music nerd.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated with a Computer Science degree and entered the world as a pianist in NYC, playing at
    restaurants, hotels, weddings, corporate events and house parties (while continuing to do
    software engineering)

  <h3>Diving Deeper into Software</h3>
  <p>
    Soon after after working for a few companies, I sought to relive the passion I
    had for programming when I making games in Scratch at 12 years old. While learning vim, I found
    Josh Medeski's videos on dev productivity which opened my eyes to the world of untapped
    optimization at every step of the developer workflow.

    I made my own dotfiles, setup custom window management and app switching macros on MacOS with
    Hammerspoon & Lua, and revamped my neovim and zsh config.

    If you're still âŒ˜+Tab'ing to find Apps, you've got to experience the speedy workflow of pressing <code
      >Ctrl+V</code
    > for VSCode, opening your hot-reloadable website on Arc Browser with <code>Ctrl+A</code>, then
    playing music on Spotify with <code>Ctrl+S</code>. You eliminate search fatigue which is a time
    and <b>mental</b> bottleneck. It has fundamentally changed the way I use a computer.

I bought this domain `gabek.dev` almost 6 years ago at the time of writing.

The `.dev` TLD was just released by Google (Feb 19, 2019) so I tried for
`gabe.dev`, which was quickly taken unfortunately.

At only 5 characters `(gabek)`, I'm pretty happy with this url. It's pretty awesome to be able to succinctly to say, "Hey, my site is `gabek.dev`" Everyone will be able to remember and spell that.

I'm gonna share all things that are cool to me and useful for the various niches. Plenty of dev content mixed in with mindset and lifestyle.
